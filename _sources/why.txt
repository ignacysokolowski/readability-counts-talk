Why readability counts?

* Code is read much more often than it is written
* Once you read your code after a long break, you won't remember how it works
* You're not the only one who will read your code
* If it's hard to read, it's also hard to find bugs


Who reads your code?

* You
* You, after a break
* Your co-workers
* Reviewers
* Users of your libraries
