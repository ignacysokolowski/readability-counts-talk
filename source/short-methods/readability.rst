==========================
Short methods: readability
==========================

* When you read a long function, at the end of it you can't remember the
  begining.
* And you don't want to read it.  (TL;DR)
* If a function is long, it usually has many indentation levels.
  When a line is deeply indented, it has to be short.  Then, there's not enough
  space to fit even quite short statements.
* Function names can replace comments.
